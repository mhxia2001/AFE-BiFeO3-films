# AFE-BiFeO3-films
This repository provides the dataset supporting the figures presented in the paper “Antiferroelectricity in BiFeO₃ Thin Films.” The data include calculated energies, polarizations, and order parameters associated with the structures discussed in the manuscript and supplementary material.
## Dataset for the paper *“Antiferroelectricity in BiFeO₃ Thin Films”*
### Energy
The first line in Energy.dat specifies the number of film layers ((equivalently representing the film thickness)), and the second line lists the energy values in Hartree.
### order_parameters_vs_thickness
The *R3c*, *Pnma*, and *P4mm* phases correspond to the R-like, O-like, and T-like structures, respectively, as defined in the paper.
#### p — polarization (μC/cm²)
#### u--local mode amplitude
#### w--octahedral rotation angles (rad)
