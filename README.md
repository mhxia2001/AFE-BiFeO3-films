# AFE-BiFeO3-films
This repository provides the dataset supporting the figures presented in the paper “Antiferroelectricity in BiFeO₃ Thin Films.” The data include calculated energies, polarizations, and order parameters associated with the structures discussed in the manuscript and supplementary material.
## Dataset for the paper *“Antiferroelectricity in BiFeO₃ Thin Films”*
### Energy
The first line in Energy.dat specifies the number of film layers (equivalently representing the film thickness), and the second line lists the energy values in Hartree.
### order_parameters_vs_thickness
The *R3c*, *Pnma*, and *P4mm* phases correspond to the R-like, O-like, and T-like structures, respectively, as defined in the paper.  
o p — polarization (μC/cm²)

o u--local mode amplitude
o w--octahedral rotation angles (rads)
### P-E_loop-data
filename: a_b_c_pz.dat
○ a--temperature
o b--beta
c--number of film layers
